                Private and Group Lessons
            </Typography>
            <Typography align='justify' color='textPrimary' gutterBottom component='p' variant='body1'>
                I offer private lessons and small group coaching both online and in person.
                While you can practice playing chess against opponents of similar skill online any time, it is more fun when you have a partner
                who you can play with regularly over the board. Group lessons are great for siblings, neighbors, or kids who homeschool together.
                They enable you and your practice partner to grow together, so that your matches remain challenging and exciting as you improve.
                I also offer lessons specifically for parents who are new to chess but have a child who has taken an interest.

                I currently host an afterschool chess club in partnership with the Waldorf School of New Orleans.
                I am currently seeking schools to partner with to establish new afterschool chess clubs.

                Why Learn Chess?
            </Typography>
            <Typography align='justify' color='textPrimary' gutterBottom component='p' variant='body1'>
                Learning chess helps kids experience firsthand that thinking hard and having fun can go together. <br />
                Math and Chess have a lot in common. They both require creative, yet disiplined, thinking.
                Math is very useful, and so kids are required to learn it in school. Unfortunately, that pressure to learn
                math often causes them to lose sight of the fact that doing math can be really fun. When students feel under pressure
                in math classes they start asking "Why do I <em>have to</em> learn this?" and "When am I going to <em>need</em> this?" <br /><br />

                By contrast, Chess is an abstract game with no practical applications.  No one is required to learn it,
                and yet, something about it makes kids feel drawn to apply their full reasoning abilities.
                No one has ever inturrupted a chess lesson to ask me "When am I going to <em>need</em> this?"
                Chess makes kids <em>want</em> to think hard.  It is an excellent medium for teaching kids to
                think out loud and to think through questioning, both skills which carry over and make them more effective
                learners in all other subjects. including math. Players also develop greater self-awareness about how their
                emotions affect their thinking process

                Chess Teaching Experience

            <Typography align='justify' color='textPrimary' gutterBottom component='p' variant='body1'>
                I have played chess for 18 years and I am currently rated ~1600, or in the 90th percentile of players on chess.com.
                I'm a long way from the title of 'Master' but I have a knack for explaining the game. At the club I went to as a kid
                I was encouraged to play 'teaching games' with other kids as soon as I had something to teach, so I've been teaching
                chess even longer than I've been teaching math! <br /> Besides establishing chess clubs at College Track and the
                Waldorf School I have taught chess summer camps offered by Strategic Thoughts in partnership with NORD.

                Chess & Test Prep
            </Typography>
            <Typography align='justify' color='textPrimary' gutterBottom component='p' variant='body1'>
                I got serious about running youth chess clubs while working at College Track. CT placed a strong emphasis on preping kids for
                fast-paced high-stakes standardized tests. I reflected on my own experience getting a scholarship based on my ACT score and I
                realized that, though the math topics covered on the ACT had been gone over in school, what had really prepared me for the test's
                pressure level and pace was all the speed chess I had played as a kid. It was chess that taught me to cope with time pressure,
                to focus my mind so that I could think clearly in a stressful circumstance. I offer discounted rates on SAT and ACT prep for
                students who add on chess lessons.
