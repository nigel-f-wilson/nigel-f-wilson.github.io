                        To be a good teacher one must remain in touch with what it feels like to be a student. <br />
                        In Eastern philosophy this is often refered to as retaining a "beginner's mind". <br />
                        To be a student is to ask questions and to pursue answers. It is to confront the unknown.
                        To be a teacher is to be a role model for students. A good teacher models excitement at learning
                        new things and is never preoccupied with keeping up the appearance of being an expert.
                        A teacher must never be afraid to say, "I don't know the answer to your question but I bet we
                        can find it together." A teacher is dedicated to being a life-long learner and realizes that all
                        learning starts with realizing that there is something you have yet to learn.
